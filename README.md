## What This Tool Does

**SNOXER** is a custom utility for Windows designed to give you precise control over your system's audio sessions through a modern interface built with Python and PyQt6.

* **Per-Application Control:** Lists and controls the volume level of every active application session (e.g., Discord, Spotify, Games) using Windows Core Audio APIs.
* **Custom Rotary Knob:** Features a unique, smooth-to-use dial for quick volume adjustments.
* **Live Visual Feedback:** The knob's gradient color and percentage display dynamically reflect the current volume level.
* **Mute Toggle:** Dedicated button for instant Mute/Unmute functionality on the selected app.

### Why SNOXER?

* **Bypass Default Mixer:** Provides a visually superior and often faster alternative to the standard Windows volume mixer
* **Aesthetic Integration:** Perfect complement for modern, dark-themed desktop setups
* **Instant Control:** Adjust specific app volume profiles without interrupting your current activity (e.g., minimizing a full-screen game).
